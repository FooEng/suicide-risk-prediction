# Predict Suicide Risk Using Machine Learning
In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to predict suicide risk based on factors such as age group, country, gender, gross domestic product, and human development index.

## Techniques Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Decision Tree Classification
* Random Forest Classification
* AUC-ROC Curve

## Data source
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016)
* [United Nations Development Programme - Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data)

## Trained Model Output
The trained ML models (stored as `joblib` format) are uploaded to the folder `trained model`. 
* Decision tree: `suicide_risk_dt.joblib`
* Random forest: `suicide_risk_rf.joblib`

## Built with
* Python
